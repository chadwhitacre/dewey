Dewey provides fast indexing and searching of your filesystem, so you can use it instead of an RDBMS. It's in the same box with:

  - Google Desktop Search
  - Spotlight
  - WinFS
  - Zope's ZCatalog

Current status is alpha. We've implemented the basic API for instantiating a so-called 'catalog' with 'indices' of your own design. There are a couple indices implemented already (Enumeration, Path, String), and there is a basic sort/limit implementation. The command-line client is both an example for the library and a useful tool in it's own right.
